//! A mutual exclusion primitive for protecting shared data in async contexts.
//!
//! This mutex is designed for use with the zio async runtime and provides
//! cooperative locking that works with coroutines. When a coroutine attempts
//! to acquire a locked mutex, it will suspend and yield to the executor,
//! allowing other tasks to run.
//!
//! Lock operations are cancelable. If a task is cancelled while waiting
//! for a mutex, it will properly handle cleanup and propagate the error.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```zig
//! var mutex: zio.Mutex = .init;
//! var shared_data: u32 = 0;
//!
//! try mutex.lock();
//! defer mutex.unlock();
//!
//! shared_data += 1;
//! ```
